RAGnarok: Unleash the power of truth in your Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems!

## 🌟 Introduction

RAGnarok is an open-source framework designed to verify and enhance the accuracy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Just as Ragnarök in Norse mythology represents a great battle leading to the rebirth of the world, RAGnarok stands as a formidable tool in the battle against misinformation, paving the way for more reliable AI-generated content.

## 🚀 Features

- Comprehensive accuracy checking for RAG-generated responses
- Advanced algorithms to detect inconsistencies and factual errors
- Customizable validation rules to fit your specific use case
- Detailed reporting and analytics on RAG performance
- Easy integration with popular RAG frameworks and libraries

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
pip install ragnarok
```

## 🏁 Quick Start

```python
from ragnarok import RAGnarok

# Initialize RAGnarok
checker = RAGnarok()

# Check a RAG-generated response
result = checker.verify(rag_response, context)

print(f"Accuracy Score: {result.accuracy_score}")
print(f"Issues Found: {result.issues}")
```
